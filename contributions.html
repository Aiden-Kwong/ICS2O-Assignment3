    <p class="body-text">Along with John Bardeen and Walter Brattain, William Shockley was the inventor of the transistor, a device that completely revolutionized everything known about computer design.</p>
    <p class="body-text">Prior to his and his colleagues' invention, computers would use vacuum tubes which were large and easy to break. The transistor was small and solid, making it far more durable and far more compact.</p>
    <p class="body-text">Modern-day computer construction still uses the transistor, and miniaturization advances allowed transistors to be crammed even tighter, with a modern-day (2021) CPU boasting an impressive <b>~15-16 billion transistors.</b></p> 
    <br>
    <p class="body-text">William Shockley and his colleagues John Bardeen and Walter Brattain received the Nobel Prize for physics in 1956 for their invention of the transistor.</p>
