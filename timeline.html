    <h2 class="heading">Timeline</h2>
    <h4 class="timeline-heading">1910</h4>
    <p class="timeline-text">William B. Shockley was born in London England, Feb. 13th, to parents William Hillman Shockley and Mary (n√©e Bradford).</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="timeline-heading">1928</h4>
    <p class="timeline-text">Shockley entered the California Institute of Technology, studying physics.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="timeline-heading">1932</h4>
    <p class="timeline-text">Shockley graduated from the California Institute of Technology. That same year, he entered the Massachussets Institute of Technology (MIT).</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="timeline-heading">1936</h4>
    <p class="timeline-text">Shockley graduated with the title of Doctor at MIT. He also began to work at <i>Bell Telephone Laboratories</i> the same year.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="timeline-heading">1939-1945</h4>
    <p class="timeline-text">With the outbreak of war, Shockley worked on military projects, particularly refining radar systems. After the war, he began investigating semiconductors.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="timeline-heading">1947-1948</h4>
    <p class="timeline-text">Shockley's team, comprised of Bardeen and Brattain, invented the first transistor without him. However, in a fit of frustration after being excluded, he followed up 9 days later with a second version which was far easier to produce.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="timeline-heading">1955</h4>
    <p class="timeline-text">Shockley left Bell Labs and founded <b>Shockley Semiconductors</b>, the first semiconductor factory in the soon-to-be Silicon Valley. The company ultimately failed due to social issues within the company.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="timeline-heading">1956</h4>
    <p class="timeline-text">Shockley, along with his colleagues Bardeen and Brattain, were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="timeline-heading">1963-1975</h4>
    <p class="timeline-text">After the failure of Shockley Semiconductors, Shockley was appointed as Professor of Engineering at Stanford University, until his retirement in 1975.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="timeline-heading">1989</h4>
    <p class="timeline-text">Shockley passed away at the age of 79.</p>
